dictionary of options with attributes\n  # angle; specifies the rotation of the polygon. An angle of zero means that\n  # the longer side of the polygon (the width) will be aligned with the x axis.\n  # An angle of +90 and/or -90 means that the longer side of the polygon (the width)\n  # will be aligned with the y axis. The parameter angle can be\n    # - a number between -90 and +90 specifying the angle of rotation of the polygon.\n    # - a string which is parsed to a number\n    # - an array of numbers, specifying the possible rotations of the polygon\n    # - unspecified, which means the polygon can have any possible angle\n\n  # aspectRatio; the ratio between the width and the height of the rectangle,\n  # i.e. width/height. The parameter aspectRatio can be\n    # - a number\n    # - a string which is parsed to a number\n    # - an array of numbers, specifying the possible aspectRatios of the polygon\n\n  # maxAspectRatio; maximum aspect ratio (width/height). Default is 15.\n  # This should be used if the aspectRatio is not provided.\n\n  # nTries; the number of randomly drawn points inside the polygon which\n  # the algorithm explores as possible center points of the maximal rectangle.\n  # Default value is 20.\n\n  # minWidth; the minimum width of the rectangle. Default is 0.\n\n  # minHeight; the minimum height of the rectangle. Default is 0.\n\n  # tolerance; The simplification tolerance factor. Should be between 0 and 1.\n  # Default is 0.02. Larger tolerance corresponds to more extensive simplification.\n\n  # origin; the center point of the rectangle. If specified, the rectangle is\n  # fixed at that point, otherwise the algorithm optimizes across all possible points.\n  # The parameter origin can be\n    # - a two dimensional array specifying the x and y coordinate of the origin\n    # - an array of two dimensional arrays specifying the the possible center points\n    # of the maximal rectangle.\n\n# Returns the largest found rectangle as an object with the following attributes\n  # width - the width of the rectangle\n  # height - the height of the rectangle\n  # cx - the x coordinate of the rectangle's center\n  # cy - the y coordinate of the rectangle's center\n  # angle - rotation angle in degrees.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .
